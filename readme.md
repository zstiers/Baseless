# Baseless

This is all very basic service level stuff. Some large amount is for optimization and another large portion has it's primary use cases in other parts of Baseless. The idea behind this is that it is code with no "base", no use or intended platform. This means it is an experimentation ground for code that is both unique and reusable.

What this is not is another man's attempt at reinventing the wheel simply because I feel current versions of the wheel aren't good enough. There is a whole lot of reinvented wheel in here, but I'm doing that reinventing for experimentation and fun.

In the event anyone does wish to contribute to this the pieces I would appreciate the most would be for cross compiler and cross platform, as well as additional benchmarks to see how this code is practically performing.
